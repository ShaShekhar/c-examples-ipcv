# C Image Processing and Computer Vision OpenCV Teaching Examples

OpenCV C Image Processing and Computer Vision legacy examples used for teaching, instruction and reference over the years (2006-2010).

All tested with OpenCV 2.x and GCC (Linux) and known to work with MS Visual Studio 200x on Win32 / Win64.
N.B. due to changes in the OpenCV API **these do not generically work with OpenCV > 2.x** and by default
(see https://github.com/tobybreckon/cpp-examples-ipcv for OpenCV 3.x C++ examples).

Demo source code is provided _"as is"_ to aid your learning and understanding -- see my textbook http://www.fundipbook.com for the theory (and matlab code also).

If I taught you between 2006 and 2010+ at [Cranfield University](http://www.cranfield.ac.uk) or [ESTIA](http://www.estia.fr) - these are the examples from class.

Most run with a webcam connected or from a command line supplied video file of a format OpenCV supports on your system (otherwise edit the script to provide your own image source).

N.B. you may need to change the line near the top that specifies the camera device to use on some examples below - change "0" if you have one webcam, I have it set to "1" to skip my built-in laptop webcam and use the connected USB camera.
